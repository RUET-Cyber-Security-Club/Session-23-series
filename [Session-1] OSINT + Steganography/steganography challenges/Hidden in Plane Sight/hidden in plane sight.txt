🔐 Challenge Name
Hidden in Plane Sight

📄 Description
This PNG image appears completely normal at first glance.
No obvious distortions, no visible clues—just a clean image.
But sometimes, secrets are not hidden in colors, but in transparency.
Take a closer look at the image channels. One specific plane holds information that is usually ignored. By carefully analyzing the alpha channel at the right bit level, you may uncover a hidden message.
Only those who look beyond RGB will find the truth.
