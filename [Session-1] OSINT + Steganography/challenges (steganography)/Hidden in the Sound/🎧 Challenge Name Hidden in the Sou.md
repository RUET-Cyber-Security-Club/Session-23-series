🎧 Challenge Name: Hidden in the Sound

🧩 Category
Steganography / Audio

📄 Description
You are given an audio file that sounds ordinary at first listen — but appearances can be deceiving.
The real secret isn’t meant to be heard, it’s meant to be seen.
Sometimes, hidden messages live in places our ears can’t detect.
Try analyzing the audio in a different way. Look beyond the waveform and explore the frequency domain.
