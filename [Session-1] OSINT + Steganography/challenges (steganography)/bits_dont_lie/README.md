Bits Don’t Lie

Description: You are given a PNG image that looks ordinary at first glance, but it contains a hidden message embedded using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. The flag is concealed within the pixel data of the image. Carefully analyze the image at the LSB level to extract the hidden information and reveal the flag.
